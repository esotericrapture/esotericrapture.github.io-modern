Aphrodite

it's dark inside.

god laughs, she says,

you're a dork. I say, okay,

but you're pulling the strings 

here. she smiles at me. some

secrets are best swallowed

straight to your intestines.

she tosses her hair into the sky.

night falls.


i clutch my abdomen like 

it is a telephone receiver waiting 

to get thrown back 

in its socket. her secret is in,

my lips feel glued to each other. i

look at her with love

in my eyes, and she sighs. 

this is heaven, she explains. it

doesn't get better than this. 

her eyes are glistening gold, 

i almost think

she's about to cry.


but gods don't cry.


i think back to the 

time i told her about me. we were

on the roof, her long legs

dangling from an edge.


winter clouded over our 

small talk like a commercial 

that kept the universe entertained. 

two weeks later, 

the mist had parted, and 

our lips met.

i'd never felt so holy before.


love had always felt like a demon, 

a cobweb kissing 

the left corner of my ribs. 

for the first time, 

i saw my secret bathed 

in the pool of an open night. 

short. dark-skinned. divine.


i want to shake her by the shoulder.

tell her how some secrets

are worth spilling, worth folding into

each other's hearts. i want to

show her that it's okay to be

mortal. to feel. but she's a god.

and gods don't feel.
