Rainbow Boy

I am a boy who braids a rainbow of chrysanthemums, my brain a pantheon of spring eternal, and a mansion residing under celluloid, across a thin divide that breaks my gender down and then surrenders every wrong pronoun and stereotype.  
I try to visualise prophets that harmonize cologne and acetone, who choose to carry home a human not defined by chromosome;  
I pick upon my trembling palm, a bud of tingling palm, my pillow warring with demonic holograms;  
a certain magic is cocooned in carving lullabies within balloons; I wash my wounds in shirts of baby pink and corduroys;  
I am a boy.


I am a boy who smells of peppermint and morning brush, and through his dawn and dusk, in saree, reads a cooking omnibus.  
A soaring dominance of condescending glances I receive;  
the ones that highly grieve are launched from staunch assumptions preconceived.  
They hurt, I heal.  


It's not my fault I chose a Barbie o'er the Man of Steel; it's not my fault I like to cook and you forgot your grain of salt;  
it's not my fault you want to thwart the ways of reason and distort the prison of my sex while you abort my female counterpart;  
and summer laughs in scorn as you respond to normalcy with paragon, and winter sheds a tear as you abuse my friend for his attire.  
And I admire my bequeathed superior place, with an ulterior distate, and you sever in two my brittle, woven braids.  


I pick them up and add them to the relics on my wall. It's blessed of me to be among the privileged of them all.  
This is me, a boy who braids chrysanthemums in rainbows, and climbs on marshmallow treehouses when he finds the gate closed.  
This is me, who wants to help, but finds his sex disgusting; this is gently rusting drops of twisted lust, and this is hatred thrust into a cup of coffee-brown acceptance, morphine on repentance, tossing out the window effort on effort at independence.  
This is sin dependent on the superintendence of society over us, a sentence ominous to slay variety with dominance;  
supremist vomitus assuming prominence- an octopus of heinous lie that turns a rock to dust- this one's for us.  


This one's for you, who prays for better morning every night. This one's for you, who wants to break their shackles of disguise;  
who wants to sanitize their day from judgement that does traumatize; this one's for you who dreams of living, and then wakes up to survive-   this one's for life.  


This one's for life, and people who desire one that's true. I know you'll rise, and rainbow boy will love to rise with you.<br>
