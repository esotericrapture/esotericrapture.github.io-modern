 *" The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth. "*
<p align="right">- African Proverb</p>

This is an intriguing proverb which has filled me with mystery and insights. I want to unravel this overawing subtlety. Man is a social animal. Abondenment is a suffering for him. Let it be a single person, but he needs someone. While being social, he has adopted the preconceived notions of the herd mentality. As he follows those principles and idelogies, he expects that the others should follow them as well.

<br>
If a person is an outlier or an outlaw, the society abondens him, makes him suffer through isolation. They have a pseudo-purpose behind this prejudice. They think an outlier is a danger for the society as he has the potential to disrupt their preconceived notions. Deep down, subconsciously they are jealous and envious about his true self.

<br>
The outliers who learn to enjoy this solitude go on to live a blissful life. The more the outlier suffers, the more the society tortures and dominates him. He must be courageous enough to ignore the noise and feel the euphoria of silence. The outlier goes through three stages of an intense emotional tycoon before reaching the so called elysium: fear, anger, silence.

<br>
Initially, he is horrorified by their tantrums andthe feeling of being a "misfit". He undertakes ceaseless endeavours to fit in the so caled moral norms of the society but experiences a great misery in the process. After feeling shattered, something else replaces this fear: the wrath of anger. In the heat of the moment, the extremely provoked outlier goes on to     
**burn down the village**. In that moment, he's the omnipotent dominant entity. The smirk has now disappeared from the members of the society. The self-righteous tyrants are now the perplexed cowards who are astonished by the rebellious act of the misfit which they never anticipated. 

<br>
The wrath of anger and fury slowly fades away. With the complete disapperance of this fury, the misfit is burdened by guilt. His soul is eaten by his conscience. As he contemplates over this situation in retrospect, he realises that he was driven by his rage which made him do the things which he'll never do when he's conscious. 


This is the milestone where an epiphany occurs:

<i>Roses are made of diamonds...</i><br/>
<i>A diamond can cherish the mood</i><br/>
<i>but a rose cannot cure the gloom?"</i><br/>

The moment he starts enjoying the solitude is the moment he becomes the resident of elysium and utopia. 

Einstein is known to have quoted: 

*"Solitude is painful in youth, but fruitful in the years of maturity."*


It's a dog-eat-dog world. Either you dominate you get dominated. It's just like binary: either you're zero or one. The African proverb implies an indispensable moral epiphany about it. It provides us insights about the potential of an outlier to disrupt havoc and wreakage if he's not solaced and embraced. 


*Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them*, a renowned blockbuster movie based on magic and wizardry illusrates this situation with the help of a concept known as an *Obscurus*: When a child is tortured and traumatised beyond measure, all his magical powers gradually turn to have the aura of dark magic. In the end, he's transformed into an obscurus: A very powerful form of dark arts where one is transformed into an evil, voilent and furious creature whose sole purpose is to cause ceaseless destruction and havoc until it runs out of it's energy.
