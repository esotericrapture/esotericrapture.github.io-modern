<p>Aphrodite</p>

<p>it’s dark inside.</p>

<p>god laughs, she says,</p>

<p>you’re a dork. I say, okay,</p>

<p>but you’re pulling the strings</p>

<p>here. she smiles at me. some</p>

<p>secrets are best swallowed</p>

<p>straight to your intestines.</p>

<p>she tosses her hair into the sky.</p>

<p>night falls.</p>

<p>i clutch my abdomen like</p>

<p>it is a telephone receiver waiting</p>

<p>to get thrown back</p>

<p>in its socket. her secret is in,</p>

<p>my lips feel glued to each other. i</p>

<p>look at her with love</p>

<p>in my eyes, and she sighs.</p>

<p>this is heaven, she explains. it</p>

<p>doesn’t get better than this.</p>

<p>her eyes are glistening gold,</p>

<p>i almost think</p>

<p>she’s about to cry.</p>

<p>but gods don’t cry.</p>

<p>i think back to the</p>

<p>time i told her about me. we were</p>

<p>on the roof, her long legs</p>

<p>dangling from an edge.</p>

<p>winter clouded over our</p>

<p>small talk like a commercial</p>

<p>that kept the universe entertained.</p>

<p>two weeks later,</p>

<p>the mist had parted, and</p>

<p>our lips met.</p>

<p>i’d never felt so holy before.</p>

<p>love had always felt like a demon,</p>

<p>a cobweb kissing</p>

<p>the left corner of my ribs.</p>

<p>for the first time,</p>

<p>i saw my secret bathed</p>

<p>in the pool of an open night.</p>

<p>short. dark-skinned. divine.</p>

<p>i want to shake her by the shoulder.</p>

<p>tell her how some secrets</p>

<p>are worth spilling, worth folding into</p>

<p>each other’s hearts. i want to</p>

<p>show her that it’s okay to be</p>

<p>mortal. to feel. but she’s a god.</p>

<p>and gods don’t feel.</p>
