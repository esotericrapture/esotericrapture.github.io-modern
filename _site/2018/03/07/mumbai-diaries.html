<p>Sometimes it so happens that in one of the most populous cities of the world, you end up realizing at nearly midnight that you don’t have a 
place to crash in. Say shitty friends or a victim of unfortunate circumstances; but at that instance, you know you’re simply… fucked.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>It’s a lovely feeling when you know that you got a couple of hours to pass on the streets maybe but you being tired from the day doesn’t 
help with things. So, you do the next logical thing.
You take your fat wallet off the jeans and punch and kick it but you know you ain’t got the cash either to rent a fancy room. You know you 
got no other options as your phone’s about to die as well. You look at the sky and you start laughing.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>That’s when you look around at the crowd of people around you and you do the “most logical thing”.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>‘Hey. I’m visiting the city here for a couple days. Came to tour it you know. Yeah, I shoot around pretty much. Been also writing a book.’</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>And ten minutes later, you’re off with a stranger to his friend’s flat who’s got this rad party going on and you don’t need me to tell that 
where there are parties, there are people.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>So, you basically talk, communicate and drink everyone’s favourite rum while being stacked in rooms with bright lights and smoke flying 
around. You find some cute eyes but you decide that it’s better to just stick to the drink for the night. That’s when you meet someone who 
takes you up to be his next best friend and an hour later, you get a nice comfy bed to crash in and fresh herbs from unknown hill stations 
to smoke.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>You have a nice night chatting about the future of the country and how everything’s shitty even though it’s not. You nod along with your 
host as he criticizes the government and then sleep like a log after it; waking up, just in time to catch the last local before your 
precious leg-space is sacrificed. And well, a few hours later with more than a hundred brilliant photographs, you end up on a train back 
home, exhausted yet strangely rejuvenated.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>So who tells you that you can’t have a hell of a night broke in a large metropolitan city? Because I and Mumbai definitely disagree.</p>
