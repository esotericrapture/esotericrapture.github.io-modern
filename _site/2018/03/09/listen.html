<h3 id="listen">Listen…</h3>

<p>The winds are howling with pain alongside me.</p>

<p>Somewhere, an old violin tears up as it sings the most desolate tunes one has ever heard. And</p>

<p>then I…</p>

<p>Like a painter, etching colours on the canvas of my body, wine red spilling from my black lips as they etch on my feverish skin.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>I shudder. The moon frowns at me through the windows of my room as I feebly try to raise my hand. It attempts but it falls, it is tired.</p>

<p>Like you who would always prefer to stay under the warm lights of my room, sheltering in music and love as you bottled me up inside your</p>

<p>soul and heart. I gaze pitifully at the reflections of the glass shards that gaze back at me; Oh, you wouldn’t have liked to see this mess</p>

<p>at all. No, you wouldn’t. Just like you couldn’t have just walked through the door now. .</p>

<p>I am crying with pain; one of the shards sticking out of my foot, my red blood mixing with the ambient maroon of my drink; the painting is</p>

<p>being completed in front of my very eyes. I lie on the floor, hungover and miserable. You didn’t have to leave, you know. Because this</p>

<p>isn’t how it usually goes.</p>

<p>First I leave, then you do.</p>

<p>But this… This reversal is insanity.</p>

<p>Pain beyond measure to see a part of myself aching to be with a phantom, gone. .</p>

<p>My hands shake as I pound the table beside me. Something heavy falls, splashing on the pool of red.</p>

<p>A necklace.</p>

<p>A last reminder.</p>

<p>The one which I had surprised you with.</p>

<p>You didn’t even take it with you…</p>

<p>Colorless drops join the ever moving fluid of shades as they settle on the object that mourns its existence.</p>

<p>I blink my eyes, my vision blurry as I now pick up the bloodied necklace from the paints of my blood.</p>

<p>I crawl near the window as I hold my prize up to the moon, the eternal canvas, it glitters; it’s red shades tearfully gazing at me, upset.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>For what was a man without his dear beloved?</p>

<p>Whose neck shall not adore the pretty bloodied necklace.</p>

<p>As both man and muse sit under the glowing moon</p>

<p>Slowly waiting… for either to die. .</p>

<p>.</p>
